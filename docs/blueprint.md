## Core Features:

- Game Board: A 3x3 grid where players can place their moves.
- Player Turn Management: Alternate turns between two players (X and O).
- Move Validation: Check if the selected cell is empty before allowing a move.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#673AB7) for a sophisticated and engaging feel.
- Background color: Very light purple (#F3E5F5), almost white, to keep the focus on the game elements.
- Accent color: Soft orange (#FFB74D) to highlight the current player or winning cells.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a versatile sans-serif font, ensuring clear readability for game elements and instructions.
- Use simple and distinct icons for 'X' and 'O', ensuring clear differentiation. They can be custom shapes rather than just the letters.
- Center the game board on the screen for a balanced and focused user experience. Keep a minimalist aesthetic with generous spacing around elements.
- Implement subtle animations, such as a brief pulse or glow, when a player makes a move to provide immediate visual feedback.
